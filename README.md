## How to Play:
    - There are 9 buttons onscreen, which aren't clickable(ironic, ik).
    - Each of the buttons are labelled according to what sounds they make.
    - To play these sounds, press on the respective buttons on your keyboard.
    - Go Crazy!

Currently, users can play sounds by clicking on the keyboard buttons. In fututre, I have plans on adding a feature wherein, if the user clicks on the button, it plays the sound.

By the way, this entire project, from start to finish, took me about 1.5 hours. It's currently 1:20 a.m. and I'm feeling quite tired. I'm going to bed now. Goodnight, world! (a Hello World! pun)
